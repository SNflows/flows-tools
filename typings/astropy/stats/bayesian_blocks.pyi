Bayesian Blocks for Time Series Analysis
========================================

Dynamic programming algorithm for solving a piecewise-constant model for
various datasets. This is based on the algorithm presented in Scargle
et al 2013 [1]_. This code was ported from the astroML project [2]_.

Applications include:

- finding an optimal histogram with adaptive bin widths
- finding optimal segmentation of time series data
- detecting inflection points in the rate of event data

The primary interface to these routines is the :func:`bayesian_blocks`
function. This module provides fitness functions suitable for three types
of data:

- Irregularly-spaced event data via the :class:`Events` class
- Regularly-spaced event data via the :class:`RegularEvents` class
- Irregularly-spaced point measurements via the :class:`PointMeasures` class

For more fine-tuned control over the fitness functions used, it is possible
to define custom :class:`FitnessFunc` classes directly and use them with
the :func:`bayesian_blocks` routine.

One common application of the Bayesian Blocks algorithm is the determination
of optimal adaptive-width histogram bins. This uses the same fitness function
as for irregularly-spaced time series events. The easiest interface for
creating Bayesian Blocks histograms is the :func:`astropy.stats.histogram`
function.

def bayesian_blocks(t, x=..., sigma=..., fitness=..., **kwargs): # -> Any:
    r"""Compute optimal segmentation of data with Scargle's Bayesian Blocks

    This is a flexible implementation of the Bayesian Blocks algorithm
    described in Scargle 2013 [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    t : array-like
        data times (one dimensional, length N)
    x : array-like, optional
        data values
    sigma : array-like or float, optional
        data errors
    fitness : str or object
        the fitness function to use for the model.
        If a string, the following options are supported:

        - 'events' : binned or unbinned event data.  Arguments are ``gamma``,
          which gives the slope of the prior on the number of bins, or
          ``ncp_prior``, which is :math:`-\ln({\tt gamma})`.
        - 'regular_events' : non-overlapping events measured at multiples of a
          fundamental tick rate, ``dt``, which must be specified as an
          additional argument.  Extra arguments are ``p0``, which gives the
          false alarm probability to compute the prior, or ``gamma``, which
          gives the slope of the prior on the number of bins, or ``ncp_prior``,
          which is :math:`-\ln({\tt gamma})`.
        - 'measures' : fitness for a measured sequence with Gaussian errors.
          Extra arguments are ``p0``, which gives the false alarm probability
          to compute the prior, or ``gamma``, which gives the slope of the
          prior on the number of bins, or ``ncp_prior``, which is
          :math:`-\ln({\tt gamma})`.

        In all three cases, if more than one of ``p0``, ``gamma``, and
        ``ncp_prior`` is chosen, ``ncp_prior`` takes precedence over ``gamma``
        which takes precedence over ``p0``.

        Alternatively, the fitness parameter can be an instance of
        :class:`FitnessFunc` or a subclass thereof.

    **kwargs :
        any additional keyword arguments will be passed to the specified
        :class:`FitnessFunc` derived class.

    Returns
    -------
    edges : ndarray
        array containing the (N+1) edges defining the N bins

    Examples
    --------

    .. testsetup::

        >>> np.random.seed(12345)

    Event data:

    >>> t = np.random.normal(size=100)
    >>> edges = bayesian_blocks(t, fitness='events', p0=0.01)

    Event data with repeats:

    >>> t = np.random.normal(size=100)
    >>> t[80:] = t[:20]
    >>> edges = bayesian_blocks(t, fitness='events', p0=0.01)

    Regular event data:

    >>> dt = 0.05
    >>> t = dt * np.arange(1000)
    >>> x = np.zeros(len(t))
    >>> x[np.random.randint(0, len(t), len(t) // 10)] = 1
    >>> edges = bayesian_blocks(t, x, fitness='regular_events', dt=dt)

    Measured point data with errors:

    >>> t = 100 * np.random.random(100)
    >>> x = np.exp(-0.5 * (t - 50) ** 2)
    >>> sigma = 0.1
    >>> x_obs = np.random.normal(x, sigma)
    >>> edges = bayesian_blocks(t, x_obs, sigma, fitness='measures')

class FitnessFunc:
    """Base class for bayesian blocks fitness functions

    Derived classes should overload the following method:

    ``fitness(self, **kwargs)``:
      Compute the fitness given a set of named arguments.
      Arguments accepted by fitness must be among ``[T_k, N_k, a_k, b_k, c_k]``
      (See [1]_ for details on the meaning of these parameters).

    Additionally, other methods may be overloaded as well:

    ``__init__(self, **kwargs)``:
      Initialize the fitness function with any parameters beyond the normal
      ``p0`` and ``gamma``.

    ``validate_input(self, t, x, sigma)``:
      Enable specific checks of the input data (``t``, ``x``, ``sigma``)
      to be performed prior to the fit.

    ``compute_ncp_prior(self, N)``: If ``ncp_prior`` is not defined explicitly,
      this function is called in order to define it before fitting. This may be
      calculated from ``gamma``, ``p0``, or whatever method you choose.

    ``p0_prior(self, N)``:
      Specify the form of the prior given the false-alarm probability ``p0``
      (See [1]_ for details).

    :class:`RegularEvents`, and :class:`PointMeasures`.
