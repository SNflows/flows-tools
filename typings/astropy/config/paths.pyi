    """
    Determines the package configuration directory name and creates the
    directory if it doesn't exist.

    This directory is typically ``$HOME/.astropy/config``, but if the
    XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable is set and the
    ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/astropy`` directory exists, it will be that directory.
    If neither exists, the former will be created and symlinked to the latter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rootname : str
        Name of the root configuration directory. For example, if ``rootname =
        'pkgname'``, the configuration directory would be ``<home>/.pkgname/``
        rather than ``<home>/.astropy`` (depending on platform).

    Returns
    -------
    configdir : str
        The absolute path to the configuration directory.

    Context manager to set a temporary path for the Astropy config, primarily

    If the path set by this context manager does not already exist it will be

    Parameters
    ----------

    path : str, optional
        The directory (which must exist) in which to find the Astropy config
        files, or create them if they do not already exist.  If None, this
        restores the config path to the user's default config path as returned
