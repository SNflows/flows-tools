class Header:
    """
    FITS header class.  This class exposes both a dict-like interface and a
    list-like interface to FITS headers.

    The header may be indexed by keyword and, like a dict, the associated value
    will be returned.  When the header contains cards with duplicate keywords,
    only the value of the first card with the given keyword will be returned.
    It is also possible to use a 2-tuple as the index in the form (keyword,
    n)--this returns the n-th value with that keyword, in the case where there
    are duplicate keywords.

    For example::

        >>> header['NAXIS']
        0
        >>> header[('FOO', 1)]  # Return the value of the second FOO keyword
        'foo'

    The header may also be indexed by card number::

        >>> header[0]  # Return the value of the first card in the header
        'T'

    Commentary keywords such as HISTORY and COMMENT are special cases: When
    indexing the Header object with either 'HISTORY' or 'COMMENT' a list of all
    the HISTORY/COMMENT values is returned::

        >>> header['HISTORY']
        This is the first history entry in this header.
        This is the second history entry in this header.
        ...

    See the Astropy documentation for more details on working with headers.

    Notes
    -----
    Although FITS keywords must be exclusively upper case, retrieving an item
    in a `Header` object is case insensitive.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : str or bytes
           String or bytes containing the entire header.  In the case of bytes
           they will be decoded using latin-1 (only plain ASCII characters are
           allowed in FITS headers but latin-1 allows us to retain any invalid

            The string separating cards from each other, such as a newline.  By
            default there is no card separator (as is the case in a raw FITS
            file).  In general this is only used in cases where a header was
            printed as text (e.g. with newlines after each card) and you want
            to create a new `Header` from it by copy/pasting.

        Examples
        --------

        to have the exact binary structure as it would appear in a FITS file,
        with the full 80 byte card length.  Rather, each "card" can end in a
        newline and does not have to be padded out to a full card length as
        long as it "looks like" a FITS header:

        >>> hdr = Header.fromstring(\"\"\"\\

            A filename or an open file-like object from which a FITS header is

        This method is similar to :meth:`Header.update` prior to Astropy v0.1.

            It should be noted that ``header.set(keyword, value)`` and

            New keywords can also be inserted relative to existing keywords

                >>> header.insert('NAXIS1', ('NAXIS', 2, 'Number of axes'))

                >>> header.insert('NAXIS', ('NAXIS1', 4096), after=True)

            to insert after an existing keyword.

            The only advantage of using :meth:`Header.set` is that it
            easily replaces the old usage of :meth:`Header.update` both
            conceptually and in terms of function signature.

        Parameters
        ----------
        keyword : str

        value : str, optional

        Update the Header with new keyword values, updating the values of

        `update` accepts either a dict-like object or an iterable.  In the
        former case the keys must be header keywords and the values may be
        either scalar values or (value, comment) tuples.  In the case of an
        iterable the items must be (keyword, value) tuples or (keyword, value,
        comment) tuples.

        Arbitrary arguments are also accepted, in which case the update() is
        called again with the kwargs dict as its only argument.  That is,

        ::

            >>> header.update(NAXIS1=100, NAXIS2=100)

        .. warning::
            As this method works similarly to `dict.update` it is very
            different from the ``Header.update()`` method in Astropy v0.1.
            Use of the old API was
            **deprecated** for a long time and is now removed. Most uses of the
            old API can be replaced as follows:

            * Replace ::

                  header.update(keyword, value)

              with ::

                  header[keyword] = value

        """
        Appends multiple keyword+value cards to the end of the header, similar
        to `list.extend`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cards : iterable
            An iterable of (keyword, value, [comment]) tuples; see
            `Header.append`.

        strip : bool, optional
            Remove any keywords that have meaning only to specific types of
            HDUs, so that only more general keywords are added from extension
            Header or Card list (default: `True`).

        unique : bool, optional
            If `True`, ensures that no duplicate keywords are appended;
            keywords already in this header are simply discarded.  The
            exception is commentary keywords (COMMENT, HISTORY, etc.): they are
            only treated as duplicates if their values match.

        update : bool, optional
            If `True`, update the current header with the values and comments
            from duplicate keywords in the input header.  This supersedes the
            ``unique`` argument.  Commentary keywords are treated the same as
            if ``unique=True``.

        update_first : bool, optional
            If the first keyword in the header is 'SIMPLE', and the first
            keyword in the input header is 'XTENSION', the 'SIMPLE' keyword is
            replaced by the 'XTENSION' keyword.  Likewise if the first keyword
            in the header is 'XTENSION' and the first keyword in the input
            header is 'SIMPLE', the 'XTENSION' keyword is replaced by the
            'SIMPLE' keyword.  This behavior is otherwise dumb as to whether or
            not the resulting header is a valid primary or extension header.
            This is mostly provided to support backwards compatibility with the
            old ``Header.fromTxtFile`` method, and only applies if
            ``update=True``.

        useblanks, bottom, end : bool, optional

        key : int, str, or tuple
            The index into the list of header keywords before which the
