      numbers of columns, this contains a 2-tuple of the column count in each
      table.  Even if the tables have different column counts, an attempt is
      still made to compare any columns they have in common.

    - ``diff_columns``: If either table contains columns unique to that table,
      either in name or format, this contains a 2-tuple of lists. The first
      element is a list of columns (these are full `Column` objects) that
      appear only in table a.  The second element is a list of tables that
      appear only in table b.  This only lists columns with different column
      definitions, and has nothing to do with the data in those columns.

    - ``diff_column_names``: This is like ``diff_columns``, but lists only the
      names of columns unique to either table, rather than the full `Column`
      objects.

    - ``diff_column_attributes``: Lists columns that are in both tables but
      have different secondary attributes, such as TUNIT or TDISP.  The format
      is a list of 2-tuples: The first a tuple of the column name and the
      attribute, the second a tuple of the different values.

    - ``diff_values``: `TableDataDiff` compares the data in each table on a
      column-by-column basis.  If any different data is found, it is added to
      this list.  The format of this list is similar to the ``diff_pixels``

            An HDU object.

        b : BaseHDU
            An HDU object to compare to the first HDU object.

        ignore_fields : sequence, optional
            The (case-insensitive) names of any table columns to ignore if any
            table data is to be compared.

        numdiffs : int, optional
            The number of pixel/table values to output when reporting HDU data
            differences.  Though the count of differences is the same either
            way, this allows controlling the number of different values that
            are kept in memory or output.  If a negative value is given, then
            numdiffs is treated as unlimited (default: 10).

        rtol : float, optional
            The relative difference to allow when comparing two float values
            either in header values, image arrays, or table columns
            (default: 0.0). Values which satisfy the expression

            .. math::

                \\left| a - b \\right| > \\text{atol} + \\text{rtol} \\cdot \\left| b \\right|

            are considered to be different.
            The underlying function used for comparison is `numpy.allclose`.

            .. versionadded:: 2.0

        atol : float, optional
            The allowed absolute difference. See also ``rtol`` parameter.
