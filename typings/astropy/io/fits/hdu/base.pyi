        Creates a new HDU object of the appropriate type from a string
        containing the HDU's entire header and, optionally, its data.

        Note: When creating a new HDU from a string without a backing file
        object, the data of that HDU may be read-only.  It depends on whether
        the underlying string was an immutable Python str/bytes object, or some
        kind of read-write memory buffer such as a `memoryview`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : str, bytearray, memoryview, ndarray
            A byte string containing the HDU's header and data.

        checksum : bool, optional
            Check the HDU's checksum and/or datasum.

        ignore_missing_end : bool, optional
            Ignore a missing end card in the header data.  Note that without the
            end card the end of the header may be ambiguous and resulted in a
            corrupt HDU.  In this case the assumption is that the first 2880
            block that does not begin with valid FITS header data is the
            beginning of the data.

        **kwargs : optional
            May consist of additional keyword arguments specific to an HDU
            type--these correspond to keywords recognized by the constructors of
            different HDU classes such as `PrimaryHDU`, `ImageHDU`, or
            `BinTableHDU`.  Any unrecognized keyword arguments are simply

        fileobj : file-like

            beginning of the HDU.

        checksum : bool

        ----------
        name : path-like or file-like
            Output FITS file.  If the file object is already opened, it must
            be opened in a writeable mode.

        output_verify : str

        Parameters
        ----------
        keyword : str
            The keyword to validate

        pos : int, callable
            If an ``int``, this specifies the exact location this card should
            have in the header.  Remember that Python is zero-indexed, so this
            means ``pos=0`` requires the card to be the first card in the
            header.  If given a callable, it should take one argument--the
            actual position of the keyword--and return `True` or `False`.  This
            can be used for custom evaluation.  For example if
            ``pos=lambda idx: idx > 10`` this will check that the keyword's
            index is greater than 10.

        test : callable
            This should be a callable (generally a function) that is passed the
            value of the given keyword and returns `True` or `False`.  This can
            be used to validate the value associated with the given keyword.

        fix_value : str, int, float, complex, bool, None
            A valid value for a FITS keyword to to use if the given ``test``
            fails to replace an invalid value.  In other words, this provides
            a default value to use as a replacement if the keyword's current
            value is invalid.  If `None`, there is no replacement value and the
            keyword is unfixable.

        option : str
            Output verification option.  Must be one of ``"fix"``,
            ``"silentfix"``, ``"ignore"``, ``"warn"``, or
            ``"exception"``.  May also be any combination of ``"fix"`` or
            ``"silentfix"`` with ``"+ignore"``, ``+warn``, or ``+exception"
            (e.g. ``"fix+warn"``).  See :ref:`astropy:verify` for more info.

        errlist : list
            A list of validation errors already found in the FITS file; this is
            used primarily for the validation system to collect errors across
            multiple HDUs and multiple calls to `req_cards`.

        Notes
        -----
        If ``pos=None``, the card can be anywhere in the header.  If the card
        does not exist, the new card will have the ``fix_value`` as its value
        when created.  Also check the card's value by using the ``test``
        argument.

        Add the ``DATASUM`` card to this HDU with the value set to the

        Parameters
        ----------
        when : str, optional
            Comment string for the card that by default represents the
            time when the checksum was calculated

        datasum_keyword : str, optional
