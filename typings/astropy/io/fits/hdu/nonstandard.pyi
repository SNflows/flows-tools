    A non-standard extension HDU for encapsulating entire FITS files within a
    single HDU of a container FITS file.  These HDUs have an extension (that is
    an XTENSION keyword) of FITS.

    The FITS file contained in the HDU's data can be accessed by the `hdulist`
    attribute which returns the contained FITS file as an `HDUList` object.
