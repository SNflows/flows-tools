This package defines units used in the CDS format, both the units
defined in `Centre de Donn√©es astronomiques de Strasbourg
<http://cds.u-strasbg.fr/>`_ `Standards for Astronomical Catalogues 2.0
<http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/vizier/doc/catstd-3.2.htx>`_ format and the `complete
set of supported units <https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Unit>`_.
This format is used by VOTable up to version 1.2.

These units are not available in the top-level `astropy.units`
namespace.  To use these units, you must import the `astropy.units.cds`
module::

    >>> from astropy.units import cds
    >>> q = 10. * cds.lyr  # doctest: +SKIP

To include them in `~astropy.units.UnitBase.compose` and the results of
`~astropy.units.UnitBase.find_equivalent_units`, do::

    >>> from astropy.units import cds
    >>> cds.enable()  # doctest: +SKIP
"""
_ns = ...
if __doc__ is not None:

def enable(): # -> _UnitContext:
    """
    Enable CDS units so they appear in results of
    `~astropy.units.UnitBase.find_equivalent_units` and
    `~astropy.units.UnitBase.compose`.  This will disable
    all of the "default" `astropy.units` units, since there
    are some namespace clashes between the two.

    This may be used with the ``with`` statement to enable CDS
    units only temporarily.
