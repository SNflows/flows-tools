This package defines units that can also be used as functions of other units.
If called, their arguments are used to initialize the corresponding function
unit (e.g., ``u.mag(u.ct/u.s)``).  Note that the prefixed versions cannot be
called, as it would be unclear what, e.g., ``u.mmag(u.ct/u.s)`` would mean.
