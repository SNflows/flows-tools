    It automatically compiles the lexer in optimized mode, writing to

    This function is thread-safe. The returned lexer is *not* thread-safe, but
    if it is used exclusively with a single parser returned by :func:`yacc`
    then it will be safe.

    It is only intended to work with lexers defined within the calling
    function, rather than at class or module scope.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lextab : str
        Name for the file to write with the generated tables, if it does not
        already exist (without ``.py`` suffix).
    package : str
        Name of a test package which should be run with pytest to regenerate
        the output file. This is inserted into a comment in the generated
