    Determine if the ``filename`` argument is an allowable type for a filename.

    In Python 3.3 use of non-unicode filenames on system calls such as
    `os.stat` and others that accept a filename argument was deprecated (and
    may be removed outright in the future).

    When overriding a __dir__ method on an object, you often want to
    include the "standard" members on the object as well.  This
    decorator takes care of that automatically, and all the wrapped
    function needs to do is return a list of the "special" members
    that wouldn't be found by the normal Python means.

    Example
    -------

    Your class could define __dir__ as follows::

        @override__dir__
        def __dir__(self):
            return ['special_method1', 'special_method2']
