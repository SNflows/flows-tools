    """
    Make a new function from an existing function but with the desired
    signature.

    The desired signature must of course be compatible with the arguments
    actually accepted by the input function.

    The ``args`` are strings that should be the names of the positional
    arguments.  ``kwargs`` can map names of keyword arguments to their
    default values.  It may be either a ``dict`` or a list of ``(keyword,
    default)`` tuples.

    If ``varargs`` is a string it is added to the positional arguments as
    ``*<varargs>``.  Likewise ``varkwargs`` can be the name for a variable
    keyword argument placeholder like ``**<varkwargs>``.

    If not specified the name of the new function is taken from the original
    function.  Otherwise, the ``name`` argument can be used to specify a new
    name.

    Note, the names may only be valid Python variable names.
