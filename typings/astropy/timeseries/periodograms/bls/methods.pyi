def bls_slow(t, y, ivar, period, duration, oversample, use_likelihood): # -> tuple[NDArray[Unknown], ...]:
    """Compute the periodogram using a brute force reference method

    t : array-like
        Sequence of observation times.
    y : array-like
        Sequence of observations associated with times t.
    ivar : array-like
        The inverse variance of ``y``.
    period : array-like
        The trial periods where the periodogram should be computed.
    duration : array-like
        The durations that should be tested.
    oversample :
        The resolution of the phase grid in units of durations.
    use_likeliood : bool

    -------
    power : array-like
        The periodogram evaluated at the periods in ``period``.
    depth : array-like
        The estimated depth of the maximum power model at each period.

        The 1-sigma uncertainty on ``depth``.
    duration : array-like
        The maximum power duration at each period.
    transit_time : array-like
        The maximum power phase of the transit in units of time. This
        indicates the mid-transit time and it will always be in the range

    depth_snr : array-like
        The signal-to-noise with which the depth is measured at maximum power.
    log_likelihood : array-like
