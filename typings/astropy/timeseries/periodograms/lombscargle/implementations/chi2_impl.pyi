    """Lomb-Scargle Periodogram

    This implements a chi-squared-based periodogram, which is relatively slow
    but useful for validating the faster algorithms in the package.

    Parameters
    ----------
    t, y, dy : array-like
        times, values, and errors of the data points. These should be
        broadcastable to the same shape. None should be `~astropy.units.Quantity``.
    frequency : array-like
        frequencies (not angular frequencies) at which to calculate periodogram
    normalization : str, optional
        Normalization to use for the periodogram.
        Options are 'standard', 'model', 'log', or 'psd'.
    fit_mean : bool, optional
        if True, include a constant offset as part of the model at each
        frequency. This can lead to more accurate results, especially in the
        case of incomplete phase coverage.
    center_data : bool, optional
        if True, pre-center the data by subtracting the weighted mean
        of the input data. This is especially important if ``fit_mean = False``
    nterms : int, optional
        Number of Fourier terms in the fit

    Returns
    -------
    power : array-like
        Lomb-Scargle power associated with each frequency.
        Units of the result depend on the normalization.
