    Find the column names mapping when merging the list of structured ndarrays
    ``arrays``.  It is assumed that col names in ``common_names`` are to be
    merged into a single column while the rest will be uniquely represented
    in the output.  The args ``uniq_col_name`` and ``table_names`` specify
    how to rename columns in case of conflicts.

    Returns a dict mapping each output column name to the input(s).  This takes the form
    {outname : (col_name_0, col_name_1, ...), ... }.  For key columns all of input names
    will be present, while for the other non-key columns the value will be (col_name_0,
    None, ..) or (None, col_name_1, ..) etc.
