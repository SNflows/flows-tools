def register_mixin_handler(fully_qualified_name, handler, force=...): # -> None:
    """
    Register a mixin column 'handler'.

    A mixin column handler is a function that given an arbitrary Python object,
    will return an object with the .info attribute that can then be used as a
    mixin column (this can be e.g. a copy of the object with a new attribute,
    a subclass instance, or a wrapper class - this is left up to the handler).

    The handler will be used on classes that have an exactly matching fully
    qualified name.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fully_qualified_name : str
        The fully qualified name of the class that the handler can operate on,
        such as e.g. ``dask.array.core.Array``.
    handler : func
        The handler function.
    force : bool, optional
        Whether to overwrite any previous handler if there is already one for
        the same fully qualified name.

def get_mixin_handler(obj): # -> None:
    """
    Given an arbitrary object, return the matching mixin handler (if any).

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : object or str
        The object to find a mixin handler for, or a fully qualified name.

    Returns
    -------
    handler : None or func
        Then matching handler, if found, or `None`
