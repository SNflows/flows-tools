def represent_mixins_as_columns(tbl, exclude_classes=...): # -> Table:
    """Represent input Table ``tbl`` using only `~astropy.table.Column`
    or  `~astropy.table.MaskedColumn` objects.

    This function represents any mixin columns like `~astropy.time.Time` in
    ``tbl`` to one or more plain ``~astropy.table.Column`` objects and returns
    a new Table.  A single mixin column may be split into multiple column
    components as needed for fully representing the column.  This includes the
    possibility of recursive splitting, as shown in the example below.  The
    new column names are formed as ``<column_name>.<component>``, e.g.
    ``sc.ra`` for a `~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` column named ``sc``.

    In addition to splitting columns, this function updates the table ``meta``
    dictionary to include a dict named ``__serialized_columns__`` which provides
    additional information needed to construct the original mixin columns from
    the split columns.

    This function is used by astropy I/O when writing tables to ECSV, FITS,
    HDF5 formats.

    Note that if the table does not include any mixin columns then the original
    table is returned with no update to ``meta``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tbl : `~astropy.table.Table` or subclass
        Table to represent mixins as Columns
    exclude_classes : tuple of class
        Exclude any mixin columns which are instannces of any classes in the tuple

    Returns
    -------
    tbl : `~astropy.table.Table`
        New Table with updated columns, or else the original input ``tbl``

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from astropy.table import Table, represent_mixins_as_columns
    >>> from astropy.time import Time
    >>> from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord

    >>> x = [100.0, 200.0]
