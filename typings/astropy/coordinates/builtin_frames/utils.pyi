def aticq(srepr, astrom): # -> tuple[Unknown, Unknown]:
    """
    A slightly modified version of the ERFA function ``eraAticq``.

    ``eraAticq`` performs the transformations between two coordinate systems,
    with the details of the transformation being encoded into the ``astrom`` array.

    There are two issues with the version of aticq in ERFA. Both are associated
    with the handling of light deflection.

    The companion function ``eraAtciqz`` is meant to be its inverse. However, this
    is not true for directions close to the Solar centre, since the light deflection
    calculations are numerically unstable and therefore not reversible.

    This version sidesteps that problem by artificially reducing the light deflection
    for directions which are within 90 arcseconds of the Sun's position. This is the
    same approach used by the ERFA functions above, except that they use a threshold of
    9 arcseconds.

    In addition, ERFA's aticq assumes a distant source, so there is no difference between
    the object-Sun vector and the observer-Sun vector. This can lead to errors of up to a
    few arcseconds in the worst case (e.g a Venus transit).

    Parameters
    ----------
    srepr : `~astropy.coordinates.SphericalRepresentation`
        Astrometric GCRS or CIRS position of object from observer
    astrom : eraASTROM array
        ERFA astrometry context, as produced by, e.g. ``eraApci13`` or ``eraApcs13``

    Returns
    -------
    rc : float or `~numpy.ndarray`
        Right Ascension in radians
    dc : float or `~numpy.ndarray`
        Declination in radians
