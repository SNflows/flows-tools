The `astropy.nddata` subpackage provides the `~astropy.nddata.NDData`
class and related tools to manage n-dimensional array-based data (e.g.
CCD images, IFU Data, grid-based simulation data, ...). This is more than
just `numpy.ndarray` objects, because it provides metadata that cannot
be easily provided by a single array.
