    The purpose of this class is to provide a dictionary for
    containing arrays of flags for the `NDData` class. Flags should be
    stored in Numpy arrays that have the same dimensions as the parent
    data, so the `FlagCollection` class adds shape checking to an
    ordered dictionary class.

    The `FlagCollection` should be initialized like an
    `~collections.OrderedDict`, but with the addition of a ``shape=``
    keyword argument used to pass the NDData shape.
