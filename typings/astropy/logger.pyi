class AstropyLogger(Logger):
    '''
    This class is used to set up the Astropy logging.

    The main functionality added by this class over the built-in
    logging.Logger class is the ability to keep track of the origin of the
    messages, the ability to enable logging of warnings.warn calls and
    exceptions, and the addition of colorized output and context managers to
    easily capture messages to a file or list.

    def log_to_file(self, filename, filter_level=..., filter_origin=...): # -> Generator[None, None, None]:
        '''
        Context manager to temporarily log messages to a file.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filename : str
            The file to log messages to.
        filter_level : str
            If set, any log messages less important than ``filter_level`` will
            not be output to the file. Note that this is in addition to the
            top-level filtering for the logger, so if the logger has level
            'INFO', then setting ``filter_level`` to ``INFO`` or ``DEBUG``
            will have no effect, since these messages are already filtered
            out.
        filter_origin : str
            If set, only log messages with an origin starting with
            ``filter_origin`` will be output to the file.

        Notes
        -----

        By default, the logger already outputs log messages to a file set in
        the Astropy configuration file. Using this context manager does not
        stop log messages from being output to that file, nor does it stop log
        messages from being printed to standard output.

        Examples
        --------

        The context manager is used as::

            with logger.log_to_file('myfile.log'):
                # your code here
        '''
        ...
    
    @contextmanager
    def log_to_list(self, filter_level=..., filter_origin=...): # -> Generator[list[Unknown], None, None]:
        '''
        Context manager to temporarily log messages to a list.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filename : str
            The file to log messages to.
        filter_level : str
            If set, any log messages less important than ``filter_level`` will
            not be output to the file. Note that this is in addition to the
            top-level filtering for the logger, so if the logger has level
            'INFO', then setting ``filter_level`` to ``INFO`` or ``DEBUG``
            will have no effect, since these messages are already filtered
            out.
        filter_origin : str
            If set, only log messages with an origin starting with
            ``filter_origin`` will be output to the file.

        Notes
        -----

        Using this context manager does not stop log messages from being
        output to standard output.

        Examples
        --------

        The context manager is used as::
