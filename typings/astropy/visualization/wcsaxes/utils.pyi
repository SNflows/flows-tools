    Transform a contour set in-place using a specified
    :class:`matplotlib.transform.Transform`

    Using transforms with the native Matplotlib contour/contourf can be slow if
    the transforms have a non-negligible overhead (which is the case for
    WCS/SkyCoord transforms) since the transform is called for each individual
    contour line. It is more efficient to stack all the contour lines together
    temporarily and transform them in one go.
