# flows-tools
Observer tools for the FLOWS pipeline

This repo is under development. It's aim is to integrate with the flows pipeline 


get_brightest.py is the HAWK-I pointing script that will create a finding chart for HAWK-I H-band images given a flows target, and optional rotation (position angle) and telescope offsets.

fixlcogt.py is a script for fixing LCOGT headers not preserved by other sripts such as imagematch.
